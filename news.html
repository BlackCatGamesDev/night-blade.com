			<h2>Nightblade Update</h2>
				<span class="date">Feb 02, 2009</span>
		</div>

		<div class="post">
<p>It's about time for an update as to the progress of Nightblade. I would like to start out by thanking all of you for your patience with the dev team as we try to balance turnover and real life with progressing the development of the mod. I'm sure you all have noticed that there have been a lack of releases and updates to the game. This ultimately comes down to the fact that we do not have the manpower to continue work on Nightblade. The team was largely being pushed on thanks to the work of Immortius and Illuminus, who have been invaluable members in keeping this project going. Unfortunately due to real life commitments, Immortius will no longer be able to make many contributions to the team. As a result, the team has been evaluating what the next step should be.</p>

<p>We have come to decide that Nightblade's work should not end here, but serious changes have to be made. As a result, I have stepped up with the intentions to reorganize and reignite the development of Nightblade. The first step in this will be to recruit heavily to ensure we have the right people with the right skill set to produce a mod that is of Black Cat Games quality. From there we will be making practical and purposeful pushes to finish the mod in a timely manner. The decision as to whether we will continue to release alpha versions of our progress hasn't been made yet, but I promise that in any case you will be kept up-to-date as to our progress. Ultimately we are making this game for you and highly value your commitment to this community and for supporting our efforts. I will be posting more information about our recruiting efforts within the week.</p>
